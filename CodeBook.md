## Getting and Cleaning Data Project Week 4

### Description
I provide additional info about the variables, data and tranformations executed in this project.

### Dataset
Data is available under this link [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Dataset Description
The experiments have been packed out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waistline. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the information manually. The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test information. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor, acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravitational attraction. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was applied. From each window, a vector of characteristics was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Description
Each record has as attribute: 
1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and the estimated body acceleration. 
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
3. A 561-feature array with time and frequency variables. 
4. Activity labels. 
5. Subject identifier.
